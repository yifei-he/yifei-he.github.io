I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my dual bachelor's degree in Data Science from the [University of Michigan (UM)](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research interest is centered around trustworthy machine learning. I currently work on i) Improving the multi-task capabilities of foundation models (e.g, multilingual LLMs, model merging). ii) Enhancing the efficiency of LLMs (e.g., semi-supervised learning, MoE). Previously, I have worked on domain adaptation/generalization and multimodal learning.
