I am a final-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/). I obtained my dual bachelor's degree in Data Science from the [University of Michigan (UM)](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). I have also interned at Microsoft Turing, Microsoft GenAI, and Amazon Search Science & AI.

I am interested in making foundation models and agents learn from multiple sources and tasks in an efficient, robust and scalable manner. My research involves the full life cycle of LLMs:
- **Pretraining**: Deriving the optimal pretraining data mixture ([Multilingual scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12883)).
- **Posttraining**: 
  - Developing model merging techniques to efficiently combine and continually edit domain specialized LLMs ([Localize-and-Stitch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13656), [MergeBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10833)).
  - Improving LLM data ([Reward modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06903)) and inference efficiency ([MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00634)).
  - Understanding LLM behavior through the weight space ([Mechanistic interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210)).
- **Agentic AI**: Training Computer Use Agents (CUA) without human annotations ([WebSTAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10962)).

<!-- - Multimodal agent for computer use (preprint coming soon!)
- Multi-domain learning for foundation models ([model merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13656), [multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12883))
- LLM data ([reward modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06903)) and inference efficiency ([MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00634)) -->

Previously, I have worked on [multi-objective optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02009), [domain adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13852) and [multimodal learning](https://jmlr.org/papers/v25/23-0439.html).
