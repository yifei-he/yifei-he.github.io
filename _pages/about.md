I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my dual bachelor's degree in Data Science from the [University of Michigan (UM)](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

My long-term research goal is to build efficient, generalizable and robust machine learning systems. My current research interest is centered around trustworthy machine learning, including domain adaptation/generalization, multi-task learning and multimodal learning. Previously, I have also worked on deep learning for healthcare and application of reinforcement learning in computational biology. In 2023 summer, I worked as an applied scientist intern at [Amazon Search Science and AI](https://www.amazon.science/), focusing on multi-task pretraining of foundation models and instruction tuning for multimodal retrieval.
